                <p style="text-align: justify;">As advances in technology make it more cost-effective to deploy
                        Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), industries will need to acquire a 
                        strategic approach to integrating new sensor data with pre-existing data environments.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Now more than ever, industries are seeking simple integrations with controls, 
                    automation, and data analytics visualization software to harness the power of IIoT 
                    and realize materialize operational and competitive benefits for their business. 
                    IIoT can unite people and systems on the plant floor with those at the enterprise level, 
                    enabling users to get the most value from their automated systems while reducing technological
                        and economic limitations.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure successful deployment of the IIoT, industrial organizations 
                    can benefit from embracing new network design infrastructures, including 
                    developing a reliable framework that supports collaborative work processes across 
                    functional lines, as well as between internal and external resources.</p>
